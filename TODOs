# Things i know i have to do and is HIGH priority after "The big cleanup":
* Redo n.versioncheck
- This checks orgiginal website but that doesnt work anymore
- Consider checking github instead
* Nickserv ghost optimize
- After ghost "(15:16:02)  -› [notice from NickServ]: YOURNICKNAME has been ghosted." mirc doesnt regain the nickname

# Ideas:
* Disable all .dll stuff if possible
- scripts\dll\i.dll can be removed (some icon stuff, i think it can be replaced with an mirc.ini settings)
- Other i.dll stuff like in dialogs i think can be replaced with the nbs.ico file i saw
* Rename all sweedish words to english (some code is in sweedish :)
* Add new echo lines for mode,join,part,quit,kick etc
- Make a checkbox or something in settings for theme??? If user want to use nbs native, mirc native or maby custom ?

# The big cleanup:
* Continue move stuff out from main.mrc
* Some time later, rename main.mrc to dialogs.mrc (thats what's left except some aliases for the dialogs)
* Continue move events to system.mrc with it's aliases (so not every alias will be in aliases.mrc)
- This is only for aliases dedcated for an event, if it's a alias like "msg" it should be in aliases.mrc
* Continue move all mp3\winamp\song stuff to own scriptfile (media.mrc)
- Search for more music stuff
* Continue move all sysinfo stuff to own scriptfile (sysinfo.mrc)
- Search for more sysinfo stuff
* Remove rcon\gaming stuff
* Remove /vote
